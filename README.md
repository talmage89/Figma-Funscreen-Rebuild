# Figma-Funscreen-Rebuild
HTML/CSS construction of a Figma site design. Figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/sX5tNR6Sqdr2dfyvxykq80/Webpage?node-id=0%3A1).

Site built on Chrome at a browser width of 1000px. Some elements may not be proportionate to design. The **Jumble** font, used for some headings in the design, is a paid font -- I used the font **Titan One** instead.

This project is hosted [here](https://talmage89.github.io/Figma-Funscreen-Rebuild/) with GitHub Pages.
